## Introduction to programming (Video number 5-8)

### Types of languages

[Good video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoE-92Ac4zE)

1. Procedural programming - well structured steps and procedures to compose a program and step by step execution

2. Functional programming - Writing a program using only pure functions. Pure functions have the following properties

   1. the function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams), and
   2. the function has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

3. Object oriented programming - based on objects

### Static vs dynamic langauges

1. Static - perform type checking at compile time and type errors will be discovered at compile time. Need to declare data type explicitly

2. Dynamic - perform type checking at run time and type errors may be discovered late during program execution. Variable data type is inferred

### Stack vs heap

**_c++ implementation_**

https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/fa2022/resources/stack-heap/

1. Stack - Stores local variables (and the data associated with the local variables). AFter a function returns, the stack memory associated to that functions and all of it's variables are deallocated. **A common mistake is to return a pointer to a stack variable from a helper function and using that returned pointer elsewhere.**

2. Heap - dynamic memory for programmers to allocate. **Unlike stack memory, heap memory is allocated explicitly by programmers and it wonâ€™t be deallocated until it is explicitly freed.**

### Prime number algorithm optimization

```
take input
initialize i = 2
while i < sqrt(number)
    if number % i == 0
        print "not prime"
        exit()
    i = i + 1

print "prime"
```

### Java Architecture

In java, everything extends into an object class.

Java is both a compiled as well as an interpreted programming language. [Compiled vs interpreted](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/)

1. The `.java` file which is human readable (soure code) is first compiled by the compiler

2. This compiler compiles the source code into `.class` bytecode which is an intermediate code that is platform independent

3. The intermediate bytecode is then executed line by line by the interpreter.

### Compiling and running file

To compile file, use the following command. This will create a compiled bytecode `.class` file

```
javac filename.java
```

To run the compiled `.class` file using the interpreter, use the following command with the name of the `.class` file.

```
java filename
```

### Basic file structure

```
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

If the file name is `Demo.java` then the class inside the file should also be named `Demo`. Any other name will not work. The `main`(from psvm) function is the entry point of any java program and therefore is necessary

`public` from `public static void main(String[] args)` is an access specifier. Since `main` is the entry point and without it the program will not run, it is necessary to make it accessible from anywhere, hence it should be specified public.

`static` is used to run the `main` function without creating an object of `class Demo`. In java, everything is based on a class-object relationship. Since main is the entry point, we cannot create an object of `class demo`. In order to create an object, we need to first run the code that creates the object and that is not possible because main is where the program starts running. We use `static` keyword to solve this problem.

`void` is the return type of the main function.

### Classes convention

All class names should begin with capital letters. For example, `Scanner` import used for taking inputs is actually a pre defined class.

### Taking inputs in java

Use the Scanner class to take inputs in java. Do not forget to import the Scanner class using `import java.util.Scanner;`

_This code will go into psvm_

```
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int number = input.nextInt();
input.close();
```

### Primitive data types

String is NOT primitive data type. It is a class. Following are some primitive data types.

```
int number = 62;
char letter = 'a';
float floatingNumber = 98.34f;
double largeDecimalNumbers = 34337.3433;
long largeInteger = 34329382329328L;
boolean check = false; // or true
```

### Literals and identifiers

A **literal** is a notation for representing a fixed constant value. For example, in `int number = 42` 42 is the literal because 42 is literally 42, a constant. Whereas the variable `number` here is the **identifier**. Methods are also identifiers.
