# Unit 1 

# What is machine learning? 

Designing mathematical models that allows computers to learn from data and perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. 

Basic developmental steps of a machine learning model 
1. Data collection 
2. Data preprocessing - label the data, clean the data, etc 
3. Train the model 
4. Test the model's performance (also called as validation) 

# Types of machine learning methods 

1. Supervised learning - model gets to train on data that is labelled. Data labelling adds meaningful information or context to the data so that the machine learning model can learn from it.
2. Unsupervised learning - model gets unlabeled data to train on. In this, the model tries to figure out patterns in data without explicit guidance. 
3. Semi supervised learning - model trains on both labelled and unlabeled data.
4. Reinforcement learning - model trains in an environment where it receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
