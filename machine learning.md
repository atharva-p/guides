# machine learning tutorial (keith)

basic steps 

1. convert data into json 
2. take that data and put into list 
3. create a class to hold data, maybe also create enumerations to handle Sentiements.
4. use the `train_test_split()` function to divide the dataset into training and testing. Unpack the returned list into different lists with python list unpacking. Additional cross validation can be performed using the stratified argument through that function.
