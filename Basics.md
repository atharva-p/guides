# Types 

Custom types can be created by using either `class` or `struct`. The amount of memory that's allocated to a variable is controlled by the type of that variable. 

## Types of type 

1. scalar types - store single value of defined range. 
2. compound type - types that aren't scalar. Examples include arrays, functions, classes
3. variables - symbolic representation of data 
4. object - instance of classes or structures 

Function templates allow for arguments of arbitrary types. For everything else, types must be explicitly stated by the programmer.
