Use **BADSCRA** to remember the layers. 

asset layer - manages assets in the iot system. includes devices like actuators, gateways, sensors and devices and other objects within the iot system. 

resource layer - the resource layer provides the sensing capabilities for the different sensors, actuators and devices within the system. This is also where gateways are placed. identification of devices can be done using RFID (radio frequency distribution)

communication layer - responsible for seamless data transfer between different devices within an IOT system. 

service support layer - provides services to perform common and routine tasks. usually offloaded to data centers or in a cloud environment. 

data and information layer - processes data to get meaningful insights from the data collected, like data analytics. 

application layer - this is where the actual user facing applications are deployed. interface between IOT system and the users. 

business layer - makes sure that IOT supports the core business or operations. 

security - makes sure the data from the IOT system is secure and prevents outside threats. 

management - manages various parts of the IOT system. 

IOT data and services - processing, managing interactions within the system and providing services.
