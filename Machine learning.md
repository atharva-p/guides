# Bias and Variance

Bias is the difference between the predicted output and the actual / expected output 

Variance is the difference between performance of a model using different subsets of the training data. 

## bias and models

A high bias also means that the model makes assumptions to build the target function about the dataset. Low bias means fewer assumptions are used and the model will be more accurate. 

A high bias model is also known as underfitting because it cannot predict data accurately. 

## variance and models 

Low variance means that the model is less sensitive to changes in data, meaning the prediction will be similar to the test data. This is called underfitting

High variance means that the model is more sensitive to changes in the training data, and can have significant changes in output when trained on different subsets of the same data. This is overfitting, it fits the data too closely and it cannot perform on new data.
